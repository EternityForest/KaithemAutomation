KaithemAutomation
=================

Flexible home/commercial automation server written in python, HTML, Mako, and CSS.

KAITHEM WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR MILITARY, AEROSPACE, IDUSTRIAL,
MEDICAL, NUCLEAR, SAFETY OF LIFE OR ANY OTHER CRITICAL APPLICATION
ESPECIALLY THE CURRENT STILL-IN-DEVELOPMENT VERSION. YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TRUST IT FOR
A SECURITY SYSTEM FOR A BAG OF FUNYUNS(tm) AT THIS POINT! 

Installation
============
clone somewhere and run python main.py
If you are really going to use this you must change the ssl keys in /ssl to something actually secret.
Don't use any important passwords because they are stil stored in plaintext(working on it!)

License Terms
=============
The original python code and and the HTML files under /pages are licensed under the GNU GPL v3.
However, Kaithem includes code copied unmmodifed from Mako and Cherrypy, two excellent open source projects.
Those projects remain under their respective licenses.

Some images used in theming are taken from this site: http://webtreats.mysitemyway.com/ and may be considered non-free
by some due to a restriction on "redistribution as-is for free in a manner that directly competes with our own websites."
However they are royalty free for personal and commercial use ad do not require attribution, So I consider them appropriate
for an open project
