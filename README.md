Kaithem is Linux home/commercial automation server written in pure python, HTML, Mako, and CSS. It's more low level than your average HA system, but it allows you to control anything python can.

It runs on python3, but it is not tested outside of Linux. Resource usage is low enough to run well on the Raspberry Pi.

You automate things by directly writing python and HTML via a web IDE. "Events" are sections of code that run when a trigger condition happens. Trigger conditions can be polled expressions, internal message bus
events, or time-based triggers using a custom semi-natural language parser.

Almost the entire server state is maintained in RAM, and any changes you make to your code never touches the disk unless you explicitly save or configure auto-save.

Kaithem also includes a module called Chandler, which is a full web-based lighting control board with a visual
programming language for advanced interactive control.

Kaithem is still beta, but I've used it in production applications running for months at a time. 

It wasn't designed for any kind of safety-critical application, but it is meant to be reliable enough for most home and commercial applications.

Installation
============

## Documentation
Kaithem's help files are being migrated to markdown. You can browse right on github,
or access the full help via the web interface!
*  [help](kaithem/src/docs/help.md)
*  [FAQ(old)](kaithem/src/docs/faq.md)


## Setup
See [This page](kaithem/src/docs/setup.md). Or, to just try things out, git clone and run kaithem/kaithem.py, then visit port 8001(for https) or port 8002(for not-https) on localhost. That's really all you need to do.

There are many optional dependancies in the .deb recommended section that enable extra features. All are available in the debian repos and do not need to be compiled, except for Cython, which is installed automatically by the postinstall script of the debian package, or can easily be manually installed with "sudo pip3 install Cython".

At the moment, Cython is only used to give audio mixer gstreamer threads realtime priority.

In particular, everything to do with sound is handled by dependancies, and python3-libnacl and python3-netifaces are recommended as several networking features require them.

### Security
At some point, you should probably set up a proper SSL certificate in kaithem/var/ssl. The debian installer will generate one at
/var/lib/kaithem/ssl/certificate.key that you can replace with a real one if you don't want to go self-signed.
