KaithemAutomation
=================

NOTE: VERSIONS 0.52 AND EARLIER CONTAIN A CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW!!!

Flexible Linux home/commercial automation server written in python, HTML, Mako, and CSS. More low level than your average HA system. May work on non-linux, but it is not tested.

You automate things by directly writing python and HTML via a web IDE. Create pages and secure them with a flexible user/group/permission system! Create events that run when an expression becomes true! An internal message bus logs events. Write HTML Pages with mako templates. Automatically generate websocket powered widgets without writing any javascript. Built in performance profiling(requires yappi). Play audio using one of several audio backends(mplayer suggested).

The entire server state is maintained in RAM, and any changes you make to your code never touches the disk unless you explicitly save or configure
auto-save. This allows experimentation without wearing out flash drives. Logs are also maintained in ram and then dumped all at once at configurable intervals. The save format is a simple JSON format that can be hand edited if needed. Most save files are never overwritten, instead a new file is created and then the old one deleted only after the new one is complete, preventing certain file corruption issues.

Kaithem includes a lbrary for common automation tasks such as file IO, timing, executing functions in the background, formatting numbers, and more.

Scheduling an event to run at 3pm is as simple as "!time 3pm" with the new special trigger expressions.

KAITHEM WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR MILITARY, AEROSPACE, IDUSTRIAL,
MEDICAL, NUCLEAR, SAFETY OF LIFE OR ANY OTHER CRITICAL APPLICATION
ESPECIALLY THE CURRENT STILL-IN-DEVELOPMENT VERSION. YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TRUST IT FOR
A SECURITY SYSTEM FOR A BAG OF FUNYUNS(tm) AT THIS POINT! 

Installation
============

All dependancies should already be included. Huge thanks to the developers of all the great libraries used!!!

git clone or download somewhere and run python3 kaithem/kaithem.py
You can also use python2 if you really want.

Command line options:
    "-c"
        Supply a specific configuration file. Otherwise uses default. Any option not found in supplied file
        Reverts to default the files are YAML, see kaithem/data/default_configuration.txt for info on options.
        
    "-p"
        Specify a port. Overrides all config stuff.


Then point your browser to https://localhost:<yourport> (default port is 8001)
and log in with Username:admin Password:password

It will give you a security warning, that the SSL certificate name is wrong,
ignore if you are just playing around, use real SSL keys otherwise.

Look at the help section and the examples module, there is a lot more documentation built into the system.

If you are really going to use this you must change the ssl keys in /ssl to something actually secret.

If you stop the process with ctrl-C, it might take a few seconds to stop normally.
If you force stop it it might leave behind a lingering process that you have to kill-9 because it holds onto the port so you can't restart kaithem.
