## Chandler
* Remove mostly unused universe status. D Replace with global alerts iframe?
* Get rid of universes management entirely?  Move all the universes to devices in the new crossframework devices spec?
* Perhaps get rid of security attempts and assume the chandler user is machine admin?
* Goto solected and edit next cue buttons very redundant D
* Hide fixture remove buttons when not needed D

## Devices
* How to represent a DMX-like interface with thousands of channels? Some kind of descriptor+binary tag?
* Tag points are definitively too slow I think.  Keeping Fixtures at least in Chandler may be a good idea.


## Main
* Auto deduplicate static files we detect as the same, to save browser space.
