The way that kaithem stores data is different from most web apps. Kaithem stores things as "ram dumps", stored in folders names after the time they were dumped. On loading the newest is chosen. Only the most recent 2 dumps are kept. On loading, if a dump is found to be incomplete(missing the __COMPLETE__ file which acts as a flag indicating consistancy) it will be renamed to <originalname>INCOMPLETE and the next newest will be tried.
