  This is a basic self test module. Warning: this will write to /tmp if it can
  and the /tmp exists.

  We put off time sensitive tests for 90s after boot
  so that the cpu intensive stuff gets out of the way,

  however under high cpu
  load a few errors may occur due to missed deadlines.
  WARNING: May leave behind things that use CPU even when deleted. You should probably
  restart kaithem to get rid of it.
