text: "Lighting control library and JS virtual light board. Requires numpy.\r\npyserial\
  \ is required to use enttec DMX adapters.\r\n\r\nNote to developers: this module\
  \ needs some work on the tight coupling between events. If you change one part of\
  \ the code at runtime, expect oddities as the old version might not immediately\
  \ go away.  This isn't enough of an issiue to really impede development though.\r\
