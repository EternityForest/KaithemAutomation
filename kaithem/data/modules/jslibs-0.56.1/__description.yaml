resource-type: module-description
text: "This module provides a few JS libraries. Note that this module may not be stable\
  \ between versions and is primarily intended for use by future included library\
  \ modules. However, the each file will not be changed without updating its name,\
  \ nor will this module change without a name change(Except in cases like the development\
  \ version). Multiple copies of this module will not conflict.\r\n\r\nThese modules\
  \ use the web resource lookup API, so the correct way to include them in a page\
  \ is:\r\n\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('jquery-3.1.0')}\"></script>\r\
  \n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('vue-1.0.26')}\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"\
  ${kaithem.web.resource('mustache-2.2.1')}\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('keyboardjs-2.3.1')}\"\
  ></script>\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('snap.svg-0.4.1')}\"></script>\r\
  \n\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"${kaithem.web.resource('element-theme')}\"\
  >\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('elementui-1.3.6')}\"></script>\r\n\r\n\
  Note: you need to include a 2.xx version of Vue.js if you want to use element UI.\r\
  \n\r\nBeware that as these are common open source libraries, no permissions are\
  \ required to access them, which could cause DoS issues if your server is public\
  \ due to the size of the files. In general DoS attacks are hard to prevent though.\r\
  \n\r\nYou can of course modify this easily as all the JS files are just pages."
