resource-type: module-description
text: "This module provides a few JS libraries. Note that this module may not be stable\
  \ between versions and is primarily intended for use by future included library\
  \ modules. However, the each file will not be changed without updating its name,\
  \ nor will this module change without a name change(Except in cases like the development\
  \ version). Multiple copies of this module will not conflict.\r\n\r\nThese modules\
  \ use the web resource lookup API, so the correct way to include them in a page\
  \ is:\r\n\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('jquery-3.1.0')}\"></script>\r\
  \n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('vue-1.0.26')}\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"\
  ${kaithem.web.resource('mustache-2.2.1')}\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('keyboardjs-2.3.1')}\"\
  ></script>\r\n<script src=\"${kaithem.web.resource('snap.svg-0.4.1')}\"></script>\r\
  \n\r\n\r\nBeware that as these are common open source libraries, no permissions\
  \ are required to access them, which could cause DoS issues if your server is public.\
  \ However the files are relatively small.\r\n\r\nYou can of course modify this easily\
  \ as all the JS files are just pages."
