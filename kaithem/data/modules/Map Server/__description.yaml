text: "Map tile server with storage compatible with KDE Marble's cache. Serves tiles\
  \ from ~/.local/share/marble/maps/earth/opentopomap, or from /home/pi/.local/share/marble/maps/earth/opentopomap.\r\
  \n\r\nNote that this does not include any form of permissions at the moment, and\
  \ serves to absolutely anyone.\r\n\r\nTo download map tiles, install KDE's Marble\
  \ and browse around, tiles are cached indefinitely.  If you are running EmberOS,\
  \ ~400MB of map data is already included and this works out-of-the-box."
