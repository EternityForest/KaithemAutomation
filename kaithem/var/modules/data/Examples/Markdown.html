# A Markdown Page

## Intro
With the display markdown option set in options, the text of the page body
is rendered as markdown without any Mako preprocessing. Useful for help files,
or using Kaithem as a CMS.


## Security

This uses Showdown.js! There is NO sanitization. Treat markdown code as you would raw
HTML, it can contain any HTML tag it wants, and only trusted users should be writing it.
