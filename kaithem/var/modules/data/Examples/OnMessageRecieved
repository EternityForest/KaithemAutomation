#This is an example of how to use a special trigger expression to recieve messages from the internal message bus
#Every time someone writes to the topic /test,  this event fires.

#__message contains the actual message while __topic has the topic
#the variable module, like kaithem, is availible almost everywhere but each module has its own instance
module.last_msg = __message
