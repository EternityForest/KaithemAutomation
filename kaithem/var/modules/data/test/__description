text: "This is a basic self test module. Warning: this will write to /tmp if it can\
  \ and the /tmp exists.\r\n\r\nWe put off time sensitive tests for 90s after boot\
  \ so that the cpu intensive stuff gets out of the way,\r\nhowever under high cpu\
  \ load a few errors may occur due to missed deadlines."
