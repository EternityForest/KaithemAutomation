    Enhancements & new features:

    * Integrated, fixed and enhanced fluidsynth 2 compatibility work done
      by Bill Peterson.
    * Added support for support for fluidsynth MIDI player and renderer
      and a new `Player` class for an object-oriented API to these.
    * Added support for `fluidsynth_settings_get*` functions.
    * Enhanced `Synth.settings` to act as a settings retrieval method as well.
    * Added support for passing bool values to `Synth.setting`.
    * Added support for passing bytes string values to `Synth.settings`.
    * Added `all_notes_off` method to `Synth` class.
    * Added `RouterRule` class (see below).
    * Added MIDI router debug handler function bindings.
    * Added tests scripts for fluidsynth MIDI file renderer.
    * Described parameter names and types for most important functions and
      methods with Sphinx-compatible syntax.
    * Added module-level constants for fluid setting types (`FLUID_*_TYPE`),
      MIDI router (`FLUID_MIDI_ROUTER_RULE_*` rule types, and MIDI player
      state (`FLUID_PLAYER_*`).
    * Added module-level constants `AUDIO_DRIVER_NAMES` and `MIDI_DRIVER_NAMES`
      listing known audio and MIDI drivers.
    * Added module-level constant `AUDIO_FILE_TYPES` listing known audio
      file types for rendering.
    * Added `.gitignore` file.
    * Added configuration for `flake8`, `pylint' and `isort` QA tools.

    Changes:

    * Bumped `api_version` to "2.0".
    * Updated copyright note at top of module source.
    * Replaced use of `future` module for Python 2 compatibility with (simpler)
      `six` module.
    * Changed import of `ctypes` module to explicitly import used names instead
      of star import to enable checking for undefined names with code linters.
    * Changed `Synth.setting` to return result of `fluid_setting_set*` calls.
    * Changed API to add MIDI router rules to be more object-oriented:

      * Added `RouterRule` class.
      * Added `router_add_rule` method of `Synth` class, which takes a
        `RouterRule` instance as argument.
      * Removed `router_begin`, `router_end`, `router_chan`, `router_par1`,
        `router_par2` methods from `Synth` class.
    * Updated list of available audio and MIDI drivers in code and documentation.
    * `Synth.start()` now raises `ValueError` if unknown driver name is passed.
    * Ordered function bindings by fluidsynth header file.
    * Re-ordered module level constants, functions and classes to be more
      consistent and in accordance with general Python best practices.
    * Re-formatted code for PEP-8 compliance, better consistency, no
      overlong lines and better separation of code blocks.
    * Moved notes about changes from module docstring to this change log.

    Fixes:

    * Replaced raising of undefined `Error` exception with `OSError`.
    * Cleaned up docstrings formatting and punctuation.
    * Made sure tests scripts find example soundfont when called from another
      directory.
    * Fixed Python 3 incompatibilities in test scripts.

================================================================================

    March 2, 2009 - 1.2.4

    * Another attempt to find the proper library on Windows systems. Added
    short circuited or expression to find either 'fluidsynth' or
    'libfluidsynth'.
    * Only import numpy when it's actually needed.

================================================================================

    January 15, 2009 - 1.2.2

    * Small version increment to update website and maintainer info.
      No actual code changes.


================================================================================

    July 22, 2008 - 1.2.1

    * Added pydoc documentation and this CHANGELOG.


================================================================================

    July 22, 2008 - 1.2

    * Changed from C extension code to ctypes for portability and simplicity
      of code.

    * Updated interface to use objects instead of just functions.
