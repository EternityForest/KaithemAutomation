["How Does This Sync Stuff Work?"]
body = """
Every record has an individual digital signature and a timestamp, plus a second timestamp for the local arrival time.

This means we can always ask a node for any new info since the last time we talked, even though there is no global ordering.

Every record also has a UUID. Newer versions of the same record win.

Records are bundled together in messages, and the whole message is signed with a node-specific key.

There's not all that much to it, except handling of moving and deleting

## Moving

 A record's location is determined by the parent property.  We maintain a *second* timestamp called moveTime(Assumed to be 0, never moved, if not present).  When intentionally moving a record you must set this property to the current microseconds time.

When you overwrite a record with one having an *older* moveTime, the moveTime and parent fields from the record with the newer *moveTime* are copied over to the new record.    In effect, we track location and content separately.


However this can only happen on nodes that have the Private Key, as it involves modifying records.

So records may appear to be in the old place until a node is able to issue a correction.


## Deleting

There are three types of deletion. nulling, silent deletion, and burning. 

Silent deletion is just deleting the record in the database.  This is impossible to propagate directly due to the tombstone problem.


Nulling is the common type.  You set a record to null. When you get or make a null record, you silently delete all of its direct children.  You can do this because you know that other nodes recieving the null record will do the same.

When you recieve a new record that is a direct child of a null, you silently ignore it.

However you cannot silently delete any descendants that are not direct children.  

The reason for this is that one of the direct children could later be ressurected by another node that moves it elsewhere, causing it's children to be reachable again, so we must not let them get deleted.

Unfortunantly this means that orphan records may be left behind whenever we delete a message with more than 1 level of descendants.

To solve this we must have the ability to manually browse for orphan records.

The first thing you will want to do is visit "My Streams" and create a new stream.   For now, this wil be purely stored on your device

Posts can have comments.  Comments are just regular posts attatched to another parent post.  You can nest these posts to unlimited depth.

You can pin a post by setting it's Pin Rank in the post info.  The higher the pin rank, the higher up the note will go.

If a post has a very short text body and at least one child, Drayer Journal assumes that the post is meant as an index, and will open that post in comment view by default.

You can also set an Icon from the included library.

## Archiving

When you are done with a post, but don't want to delete it, click the Archive button.  It will move the post into an Archive note.  The archive note will have the same parent as the post you just archived.

You can freely edit and rename the archive post.  In fact, if you really want, you can move the archive post somewhere completely different, and archived posts in that folder will still go there.

Unlike real spreadsheets, rows have names that must be unique.  If you try to create a duplicate it will take you to the existing row, and the sync engine will replace older with newer rows of thr same name.

This is intended to help with things like counts and surveys, if you have 100 numbered boxes, this feature helps avoid double counting.


As every data column has -- and ++ buttons to easily increment, you can use them as todo lists for procedures thar must be repeated the same way every time, as every row becomes in effect a checklist or form to fill out.  Using 1 for done is the suggested convention.

Drayer can sync to another device, as long as the device you choose to use as the server is on WiFi.

This feature requires UPnP or a manually opened port if you want to sync over the internet, but should always work on the same LAN.


In global settings on the server node, set a title for the sync server.  Now, on the server node, go into the stream settings and show the sharing code.

On the client device, scan this with any QR scanner app and copy to clipboard.  Go to stream settings and load this code by pasting into the dialog.

The two streams should have the same synkKey and writePassword, and the Client's server URL should ve the same as the one you see in the "Discover Services" panel.



Any notes you have in one stream will sync to all devices.  If the same note is editied on two computers, the latest one wins, so be sure not to step on each other's toes.   Commets are completely separate posts, and you should not have any issues editing posts and comments at the same time.


Occasionally, due to the P2P sync protocol, children of deleted posts can become unreachable. In the settings menu you can list out such unreachable notes and delete or restore them.

The sync engine is custom and does not use a blockchain. it fully supports multiple writers and does not have the "Endlessly growing chain" problem, except in that deleted notes become hidden null records.



It is possible to share read-only access to a Stream too.
