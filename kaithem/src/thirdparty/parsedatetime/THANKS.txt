While the initial work on parsedatetime is based on my past work
in dealing with validation of date/time text, the current code
could not have happened without the help, aid and pokings of the
following folks:

Darshana Chhajed

    As the first "real" user of the new Python code, Darshana pointed
    out many of the initial flaws and bugs and then started fixing them!
    Her aide was so helpful that I was happy to add her as co-author.

Ted Leung

    Early "sounding board" advice and continued support to make the
    code as open and useful as it is.

Heikki Toivenan

    While Heikki hasn't aided directly he has been extremely helpful
    in making sure my Python code is clean and simple - any current
    ugliness is purely my own fault

OSAF

    The folks at OSAF (Open Source Applications Foundation) helped a lot
    in shaping how the code works and in answering my "how do I do *this*"
    questions - especially Jeffrey, Philippe, Grant, Andi, Alex and Katie.
