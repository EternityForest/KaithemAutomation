class Hue(float):
    """
    Represents the hue of a :class:`Color` for use in transformations.
    Instances of this class can be constructed directly with a float value in
    the range [0.0, 1.0) representing an angle around the `HSL hue wheel`_. As
    this is a circular mapping, 0.0 and 1.0 effectively mean the same thing,
    i.e.  out of range values will be normalized into the range [0.0, 1.0).

    The class can also be constructed with the keyword arguments ``deg`` or
    ``rad`` if you wish to specify the hue value in degrees or radians instead,
    respectively. Instances can also be constructed by querying the
    :attr:`Color.hue` attribute.

    Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are supported with :class:`Color`
    instances. For example::

        >>> Color(1, 0, 0).hls
        HLS(h=0.0, l=0.5, s=1.0)
        >>> (Color(1, 0, 0) + Hue(deg=180)).hls
        HLS(h=0.5, l=0.5, s=1.0)

    Note that whilst multiplication by a :class:`Hue` doesn't make much sense,
    it is still supported. However, the circular nature of a hue value can lead
    to suprising effects. In particular, since 1.0 is equivalent to 0.0 the
    following may be observed::

        >>> (Hue(1.0) * Color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0)).hls
        HLS(h=0.0, l=0.5, s=1.0)
