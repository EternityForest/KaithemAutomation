You can easily check if tinytag does the right thing by placing test files in
this folder.

The name of the test file will automatically create a test, when running nosetests.

For example the file

    some-funky-name-d=10.5-sr=44100.mp3

will run a test that checks if the file has a duration of 10.5 and a samplerate
of 44100 seconds.

These are the prefixes that can be used for the expected values:

    sr - samplerate
    d - duration
    b - bitrate
    c - channels
    dn - disc number
    dt - disc total
