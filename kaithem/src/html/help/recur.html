<title>The Recur DSL</title>

<p>The expression creation syntax is fairly simple. Generally you can enter plain English expressions and they will usually just work.</p>
<p>Example expressions that should work: "every day", "every 5 minutes", 
    "every 10 minutes on Tuesday", "Every hour on the 3rd day of the month", "every 8 seconds",
    "every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday", "every 3rd Tuesday of the month", "In January", "between 5:30PM and 10AM","every 10 minutes until jun 27 2017",etc </p>

<p>Statements can be arbitrarily combined. Events will occur at the start of the matched period. Intervals like
    "every 3 days" are presumed to start on 1/1/0001 at midnight. To change the "alignment" of intervals, use the "starting at"
    directive, as in "every 5 days starting Jun 10th". This will select a set of times with the first being Jun 10 0001 at midnight.
</p>

<p>Recur supports several ways of specifying date and time, but the suggested way is "4:30PM Jun 7 2017" and similar.
    all times without AM or PM are assumed to be 24 hour time.</p>

<p>There may be bugs in Recur regarding upper and lower case. If something doesn't work in uppercase it may be of the case sensitive constructs.
    This should be resolved in the future.</p>

<p>Recur is a new library and does not yet support
    all common ways of describing time, and is also english only at the moment. For more info, or to file any bugs 
    or pull requests, check out the <a href="https://github.com/EternityForest/recur">recur repo</a> at github.</p>
