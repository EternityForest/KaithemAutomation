<title>The Recur DSL</title>

<p>The expression creation syntax is fairly simple. Generally you can enter plain English expressions and they will usually just work.</p>
<h3 id="data-types">Data types</h3>
<p>While there are no “variables” and the language is purely declarative, there are datatypes that are required as arguments to the constraints.</p>
<h4 id="integers">Integers</h4>
<p>Integers always just look as you would expect. 1, 2, 3, etc.</p>
<h4 id="ordinals">Ordinals</h4>
<p>An ordinal is a number such as <code>1st</code>, <code>2nd</code>, <code>3rd</code>, etc. The word <code>other</code> is also considered an ordinal equal to 2, and first, second, and thrid behave as expected.</p>
<h4 id="months">Months</h4>
<p>A month may be specified in full, as in <code>june</code>, <code>july</code>, <code>august</code>, or by the first three letters of it’s name, as in <code>jun</code>, <code>jul</code>,<code>aug</code></p>
<h4 id="years">Years</h4>
<p>Years must always be specified as full 4 or more digit years. If you need to reference a year before <code>1000</code>, use leading zeros as in <code>0001</code></p>
<h4 id="days-of-the-month">Days of the month</h4>
<p>A day of the month is simply specified as an integers</p>
<h4 id="times-of-day">Times of day</h4>
<p>The following are all valid time formats: <code>4pm</code>, <code>4:46pm</code>, <code>16:14</code>(Times without am or pm are assumed to use 24h time),<br />
<code>1:14pm</code>, <code>1:56:44</code>, <code>11:56:44am</code>, <code>1:12:34:0068am</code>(The last four are the milliseconds).</p>
<h4 id="dates">Dates</h4>
<p>The following are all valid date formats: <code>jun 2 2016</code>, <code>feb 3rd 2016</code>, <code>2 jan 2016</code></p>
<h4 id="dates-without-years">Dates without years</h4>
<p>For dates not associated with a year the following are valid: <code>2 jun</code>, <code>2 june</code>, <code>june 4th</code>, <code>the 2nd of june</code></p>
<h4 id="weekdays">Weekdays</h4>
<p>These can be specified as <code>mon</code>, <code>tue</code>, <code>thurs</code>, or <code>Monday</code>, <code>Tuesday</code>, <code>Thursday</code></p>
<h4 id="intervals">Intervals</h4>
<p>These are used in expressions like <code>every 3 weeks</code>, The valid intervals are <code>week</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code>, <code>second</code>.<br />
You may use the signular or plural forms as appropriate in most places(e.g. <code>every week</code> and <code>every 2 weeks</code>)</p>
<h4 id="lists">Lists</h4>
<p>Lists are delimited by the comma and by the word and. <code>1,2, and 3</code> is a list of integers, while <code>1st, 2nd, and 3rd</code> is a list of ordinals.</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<p>A constraint is an object that matches a set of ranges of time. Putting two or more constraints next to each other creates a meta-constraint acting as a set intersection, in other words matching only the time matched by all of it’s members.</p>
<p>For example, <code>every five minutes in january</code> matches only those times that are part of the fifth minute and also in january.</p>
<p>Note that we consider there to be a zero width non matching space between matches of a constraint, so 12:05 and 12:10 are separate matches.</p>
<h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>
<p>By default constraints “align” to 1/1/1. This means that the expression “every year” will match a set of ranges starting Jan 1 at midnight each year. To change this we can use the “starting at” expression, which acts globally for the entire expression, and accepts a date, date with a year, time, or any combination thereof. Missing fields will be replaced with the corresponding value from midnight 1/1/1(So “Jan 1 0001 at midnight” is the same as “midnight”).</p>
<p><code>every year starting Jan 9 2014</code> matches a set of ranges starting on Jan 9 every year. In effect,</p>
