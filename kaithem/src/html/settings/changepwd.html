    <details class="help"><summary><i class="mdi mdi-help-circle-outline"></i></summary>Password attempts will be rate limited for passwords under 32 chars(which
        are assumed to be strong enough to resist attacks without limiting).
        This rate limiting is standard practice on many systems, but also makes it very
        easy for an attacker to lock you out.</br>
        For DoS protection, consider using a five-word diceware style passwords</details>

        <p>Passwords are currently stored on the server using SHA256 and a 16-byte salt.
            The password file is currently not designed to be secure against attackers with physical
            access to the server unless you use an extremely strong password(80-100 bits or more).
