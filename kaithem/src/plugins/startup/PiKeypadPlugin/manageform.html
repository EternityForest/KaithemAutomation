<h3>Info</h3>
<p>
    This driver handles a matrix keypad connected to a Raspberry Pi, via the rpi.gpio driver.

    It will work on other platforms as well, as a "fake" keypad that can only be triggered manually via this page.
</p>

<p>
    In test mode, keypresses will always be printed to this page(With [IGNORED] in the title), and they will not trigger callbacks or be posted to the message bus.

   You can still send commands through this page while in test mode, and they will behave as usual.
</p>


<h3>Virtual Keypad</h3>
<p class="help">These keys have the same effect as pressing the real keys, except they still work in test mode.</p>
