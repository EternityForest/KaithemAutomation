<h3>Info</h3>
<p class="help">
  This allows you to expose kaithem for remote access anywhere in the world, even from an Android phone. See https://github.com/EternityForest/hardlinep2p for the client side.  There is no
  service or anying to register for, discovery is done using distributed hash tables and public servers.
</p>

<p class="warning">
    WARNING:  This is truly public.  Do NOT use this without a very strong password.  Once set up, anyone will be able to
    access Kaithem as if they were on your local network. Also, this functionality should be considered alpha!!!!  Don't trust it with your nuclear launch codes.
