    pyFluidSynth

    Python bindings for FluidSynth

    Copyright 2008-2019, Nathan Whitehead <nwhitehe@gmail.com> and others


    Released under the LGPL

    This module contains python bindings for FluidSynth.  FluidSynth is a
    software synthesizer for generating music.  It works like a MIDI
    synthesizer.  You load patches, set parameters, then send NOTEON and
    NOTEOFF events to play notes.  Instruments are defined in SoundFonts,
    generally files with the extension SF2.  FluidSynth can either be used
    to play audio itself, or you can call a function that returns chunks
    of audio data and output the data to the soundcard yourself.
    FluidSynth works on all major platforms, so pyFluidSynth should also.
